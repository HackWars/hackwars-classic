# HackWars a History

The HackWars MMORPG began in 2005, as a university project of Benjamin Coe,
Cameron McGuinness, Christian Battista, and Alexander Morrison.

The unique game, which combines a real programming language, with MMO game
mechanics has a great success: thousands of players enjoyed playing it throughout
the years, and an amazing open-source community grew up around it.

Alas, it is now virtually impossible to run a Java Applet in modern web-browsers
which brings us to a new stage in HackWars' history -- let's rebuild an
open-source version in JavaScript.

## What's This?

This repo contains the crufty code for the original HackWars' Java Applet,
warts intact.
